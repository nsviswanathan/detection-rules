# Detection Engineer Portfolio Highlight

Built a production-ready detection engineering repository containing Sigma, YARA, and SIEM hunting rules aligned to MITRE ATT&CK.
Implemented detections across credential access, execution/defense evasion, persistence, and lateral movement, and validated behavior-based detections using Atomic Red Team adversary emulation.
Documented ATT&CK technique coverage in a coverage matrix and established rule authoring standards for severity, telemetry requirements, tuning, and false-positive reduction to support real SOC workflows.
